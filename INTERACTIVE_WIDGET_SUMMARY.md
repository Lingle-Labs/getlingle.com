4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear icons, colors, and typography guide user attention
5. **Call-to-Action**: Each widget has prominent buttons encouraging interaction

### Educational Value

- **Grammar Focus**: Smart feedback addresses common ESL challenges

## Performance Considerations
- Lightweight JavaScript with no external dependencies
- CSS animations use transform and opacity for optimal performance
